class KShape():
    """
    KShape clustering for time series.

    KShape was originally presented in [1]_ and this implementation is based on the 
    one published on [2]_

    Parameters
    ----------
    k: int
        Number of clusters.
    
    rnd_labels: bool (default: False)
        When no labels are provided during the fitting process, this flags selects between
        sequentially assigning time series to clusters (default) or to initially assing 
        sequences to clusters using a uniform distribution.
    
    max_iterations: int (default: 100)
        Maximum number of iterations.

    Attributes
    ----------
    labels_: ShapeletsArray
        Computed labels for the training set.
    
    centroids_: ShapeletsArray
        Computed centroids implied from the training set.

    Notes
    -----
    Time series are expected in columnar layout, that is, if presented with a NxM matrix, data 
    will be interpreted as M time series of N elements.

    This class do not support arbitrary labels.  Labels must be integers ranging from 0 (inclusive) to 
    k (exclusive).
